      "description": "Smart Drainage Monitor Project Description\n\nThe Smart Drainage Monitor is an innovative IoT-based system designed to prevent urban flooding by monitoring drainage chambers, detecting blockages, and automating clearance. This project addresses the critical issue of clogged drains, which often lead to waterlogging in cities, causing damage and disruption. By combining advanced hardware, cloud technology, and a user-friendly Android app, the system ensures real-time monitoring and efficient management of drainage systems.\n\nProject Overview\n\nThe Smart Drainage Monitor uses an ESP32-S3 microcontroller to collect data from multiple sensors, including water level, sonar (HC-SR04), gas (MQ8), temperature (LM35), IR, flame, and GPS modules. These sensors act as the system’s “eyes,” detecting water levels, potential blockages, and environmental conditions. The data is sent to Firebase Realtime Database, a cloud-based “notebook” that stores and updates sensor readings instantly. The Android app, developed as the primary user interface, displays this data, alerts users to blockages, and allows manual or automatic control of a servo motor to clear drains.\n\nKey Features\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-Time Monitoring: The app shows water levels for three drainage chambers, updated every 2 seconds, using a modern interface with a purple-blue gradient and bold “Smart Drainage Monitor” title.\n\n\n\nBlockage Detection: If two chambers are full and one is empty (e.g., [1, 1, 0]), the empty chamber is flagged as blocked, turning its display red with a “Blockage Detected” alert.\n\n\n\nSensor Insights: Displays data from sonar (proximity < 5 cm triggers a “Proximity Alert”), gas, temperature, and GPS, with default coordinates (23.812121, 90.357929) if GPS is unavailable.\n\n\n\nUser Controls: Includes a map button to view the drain’s location on Google Maps, a refresh button for manual data updates, and servo switches for manual or auto mode (10-second activation, 10-minute cooldown).\n\n\n\nAlerts: Clear red alerts for blockages or proximity issues, ensuring users are informed of critical conditions.\n\nTechnical Components\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware: ESP32-S3 with sensors (e.g., HC-SR04 on GPIO 12/13, servo on GPIO 15) running MicroPython to collect and send data to Firebase.\n\n\n\nSoftware: Android app (Java, minSdk 26) with Firebase integration (firebase-database:20.3.0) and a sleek UI using CardView and ProgressBar.\n\n\n\nCloud: Firebase Realtime Database stores sensor data (sensor_data) and servo control settings (servo_control).\n\nChallenges and Solutions\n\nChallenges included unreliable sensor data display and incorrect temperature readings (e.g., 330°C). These were addressed by implementing robust Firebase listeners, a manual refresh button, and suggesting hardware calibration for the LM35 sensor. The app reliably displays data and alerts, ensuring a seamless user experience.\n\nImpact and Future Work\n\nThe Smart Drainage Monitor enhances urban infrastructure by providing a proactive solution to flooding. The Android app, with its intuitive design and real-time alerts, empowers users to monitor and manage drainage systems effectively. Future enhancements could include push notifications for instant alerts and support for additional chambers to scale the system.\n\nThis project, with the Android app as my key contribution, demonstrates how technology can solve real-world problems, making cities safer and more resilient.",
